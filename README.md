# Taxi-ETL-Analytics

_Written by Michael Kamkar_

This project is an ETL & data analytics project. Using the 2013 NYC Yellow Cab Trip data (27 GB unzipped of CSV files), I will:

1. Dump data into a postgres staging area
2. Clean the dataset (remove outliers and duplicates)
3. Create a star schema data warehouse, and load cleaned data into it
4. Query the data warehouse to run analytics/visualization on data

This project is currently ongoing, currently on step 2. 

The dataset was acquired through the link below using trip_data.7z:
